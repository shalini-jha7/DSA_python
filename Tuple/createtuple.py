# tuple is immutable sequence of python objects
# creating a tuple: it is done by using keyword tuple.
newTuple = tuple('abc')
print(newTuple)
newTuple = tuple('123')
print(newTuple)

#time ccomplexity for creating tuple is O(1)
# space complexity for creating a tuple is O(n), as it depends on the number of elemets in it
